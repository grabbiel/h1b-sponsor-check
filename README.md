# h1b-sponsor-checker (h1b-wizard)
We understand: you get anxious wondering whether XYZ company will be willing to sponsor you, and so you read carefully every job description to find that "U.S. citizens only" one-liner. But you don't have to.

Use this extension instead, and your job search will be a smart search: save both your time and your peace of mind while browsing through LinkedIn.

In this repository you will find all the source code used by the extension. Commits are welcomed, and pull requests are encouraged. This extension is not-for-profit, as we believe the international student community deserves this tool.

Features currently in the making:
- **ETL pipeline connecting to DynamoDB** instance to enhance the textual analysis capabalities of the extension, and later predict sponsoring faster.
- **Donation checkout system** for whomever might wish to contribute to the development team.
- Core functionalities working **in Indeed and Glassdoor**.
- Analytics dashboard for user experience enhancement.
